Green Software Engineering is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software practices and architecture, electricity markets, hardware and data center design.

The Principles of Green Software Engineering are a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run green sustainable software applications.

These eight principles form a shared understanding of what it means to be a Green Software Engineer independent of:

Application domain.
Industry.
Organization size or type.
Cloud vendor or self-hosted.
Programming language or framework.
Through the synthesis of this knowledge, a Green Software Engineer can make decisions which have a meaningful impact on the carbon pollution of their applications.
Sustainability is enough, all by itself, to justify our work.permalink
As Green Software Engineers, we recognize there are many advantages to building sustainable applications. They are almost always cheaper, they are often more performant, they are often more resilient. But the primary reason we are practicing Green Software Engineering is for sustainability, everything else is an added advantage


AS we require time and technical person support we presented only a part of our project.with sufficient time we did our best.
                                              
                                                         THANK YOU
